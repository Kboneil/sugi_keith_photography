# Sugi Keith Photography

A photography website built to display pictures taken by my mother, Sugi Keith O'Neil.

It was started during a GitHub challenge (30 day sprints devoted to learning an practicing a new technology and requiring a commit each day). For the first sprint I learned Sass and implemented it on the website and also improved my knowledge of jQuery.
